# WTest
Android Challenge MVVM with:
- Room
- Retrofit
- Hilt
- Coroutines

The application, when started for the first time, downloads a file that is present in the repository(https://github.com/centraldedados/codigos_postais) and stores it in a database.

When the application is started, all data from the database is retrieved and saved locally, so that when the user filters the list there is no need to query it.

Note: Make sure you have an internet connection as the application does not address this fact.
