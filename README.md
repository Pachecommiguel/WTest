# WTest
Android Challenge MVVM with:
- Room
- Retrofit
- Hilt
- Coroutines

The application, when started for the first time, downloads a file that is present in the repository(https://github.com/centraldedados/codigos_postais) and stores it in a database.

Note: Make sure you have an internet connection as the application does not address this fact.
